# Pachca Integration Bot

A webhook-based integration bot that forwards notifications from GitHub and custom systems to [Pachca](https://pachca.com) channels with rich, hyperlinked markdown formatting.

## Features

- **GitHub Webhooks** — releases, failed CI checks/workflows, pull requests (full lifecycle with threads), deployments
- **Thread-based PR Tracking** — each PR gets one parent message; status changes are posted as thread replies and the parent is updated
- **Generic Webhooks** — alert / deploy / custom events from any system (VMs, monitoring, CI)
- **Structured Messages** — composable Pydantic models that render to Pachca markdown with hyperlinks
- **Security** — HMAC-SHA256 verification for GitHub, Bearer token auth for generic endpoint

## Quick Start

```bash
uv sync
uv run python -m pachca_bot
```

## Configuration

All settings are read from environment variables:

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PACHCA_ACCESS_TOKEN` | yes | — | Pachca API bot token |
| `PACHCA_CHAT_ID` | no* | — | Fallback chat ID when integration-specific ID not set |
| `GITHUB__PACHCA_CHAT_ID` | no* | — | Target chat for GitHub integration |
| `GENERIC__PACHCA_CHAT_ID` | no* | — | Target chat for generic integration |
| `GITHUB__WEBHOOK_SECRET` | yes* | — | GitHub HMAC secret (required for `/webhooks/github`) |
| `GENERIC__WEBHOOK_SECRET` | yes* | — | Bearer token for generic endpoint (required for `/webhooks/generic`) |
| `GITHUB__BOT_DISPLAY_NAME` | no | `"GitHub Bot"` | Display name for GitHub messages |
| `GENERIC__BOT_DISPLAY_NAME` | no | `"Events Bot"` | Display name for generic messages |
| `GITHUB__BOT_DISPLAY_AVATAR_URL` | no | [default](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Misery7100/pachca-bot/main/images/github-bot.png) | Avatar URL for GitHub messages |
| `GENERIC__BOT_DISPLAY_AVATAR_URL` | no | [default](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Misery7100/pachca-bot/main/images/events-bot.png) | Avatar URL for generic messages |
| `HOST` | no | `0.0.0.0` | Server bind address |
| `PORT` | no | `8000` | Server bind port |
| `MESSAGES_MAX_SCAN` | no | `500` | Max messages to scan when searching chat for PR/deploy threads |

\* At least one of `PACHCA_CHAT_ID`, `GITHUB__PACHCA_CHAT_ID`, or `GENERIC__PACHCA_CHAT_ID` must be set. Use `PACHCA_CHAT_ID` alone for both integrations, or set integration-specific IDs to route GitHub and generic events to different chats. `GITHUB__WEBHOOK_SECRET` and `GENERIC__WEBHOOK_SECRET` are required for their respective endpoints — requests are rejected with 403 if the secret is not configured.

**Backward compatibility:** Flat env vars (`GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `GITHUB_PACHCA_CHAT_ID`, etc.) are still supported and mapped to the nested format.

## Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/health` | GET | — | Health check |
| `/webhooks/github` | POST | HMAC-SHA256 (`X-Hub-Signature-256`) | GitHub webhook receiver |
| `/webhooks/generic` | POST | Bearer token (`X-Authorization`) | Generic webhook receiver |

## GitHub Integration Setup

### Step 1: Deploy the bot

Deploy the bot somewhere publicly accessible (e.g. a VPS, cloud VM, or container platform). The bot listens on port `8000` by default.

```bash
# Using Docker (single chat for both integrations)
docker build -t pachca-bot .
docker run -d --name pachca-bot -p 8000:8000 \
    -e PACHCA_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-pachca-bot-token" \
    -e PACHCA_CHAT_ID="your-chat-id" \
    -e GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET="your-secret-here" \
    pachca-bot

# Or use separate chats per integration
docker run -d --name pachca-bot -p 8000:8000 \
    -e PACHCA_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-pachca-bot-token" \
    -e GITHUB__PACHCA_CHAT_ID="github-chat-id" \
    -e GENERIC__PACHCA_CHAT_ID="generic-chat-id" \
    -e GITHUB__WEBHOOK_SECRET="your-secret-here" \
    -e GENERIC__WEBHOOK_SECRET="your-generic-secret" \
    pachca-bot
```

### Step 2: Generate a webhook secret

Generate a random secret string. This will be shared between GitHub and the bot to verify webhook authenticity.

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Set this as the `GITHUB__WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable for the bot.

### Step 3: Configure the GitHub webhook

1. Go to your GitHub repository → **Settings** → **Webhooks** → **Add webhook**
2. Fill in the fields:
   - **Payload URL**: `https://your-bot-host/webhooks/github`
   - **Content type**: `application/json`
   - **Secret**: paste the secret from Step 2
3. Under **"Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?"**, select **"Let me select individual events"** and check:
   - ✅ **Check suites** — for PR check status (posts "All checks passed" to thread; promotes to "Ready to merge" only with approval)
   - ✅ **Deployments** — for deployment notifications
   - ✅ **Deployment statuses** — for deployment status updates
   - ✅ **Pull requests** — for PR lifecycle (draft, opened, ready for review, merged, closed)
   - ✅ **Pull request reviews** — for review submitted, edited, or dismissed (posted to PR thread)
   - ✅ **Releases** — for release notifications
   - ✅ **Workflow runs** — for CI failure notifications
4. Optionally also check:
   - ✅ **Check runs** — for individual check run failure notifications
5. Make sure **Active** is checked
6. Click **Add webhook**

GitHub will send a `ping` event to verify the webhook is working. You should see a confirmation message in your Pachca channel.

### Supported GitHub Events

| Event | Actions | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `release` | `published` | Posts release notification with changelog |
| `pull_request` | `opened`, `closed`, `reopened`, `ready_for_review`, `converted_to_draft`, `synchronize` | Creates/updates PR message with thread-based status tracking |
| `pull_request_review` | `submitted`, `edited`, `dismissed` | Posts review (approved/changes requested/commented) to PR thread |
| `check_suite` | `completed` (success) | Posts per-check "**Status updated:** ✅ {name} passed" to PR thread; promotes to "Ready to merge" only if approval exists |
| `workflow_run` | `completed` (failure/cancelled) | Posts CI failure — to PR thread if associated, otherwise to channel |
| `check_run` | `completed` (failure) | Posts individual check failure notification |
| `deployment` | `created` | Posts deployment notification |
| `deployment_status` | `created` | Posts deployment status update |

### PR Lifecycle

The bot tracks pull requests through their full lifecycle using **thread-based messaging**:

| Status | Emoji | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| Draft | 📝 | PR opened with `draft: true` |
| Open | 🆕 | PR opened (non-draft) or reopened |
| Ready for review | 👀 | PR marked as ready for review |
| Ready to merge | ✅ | All checks passed **and** at least one approval |
| Merged | 🟣 | PR closed with `merged: true` |
| Closed | 🚫 | PR closed without merge |

**How it works:**
1. When a new PR is created (draft or regular), the bot posts a parent message to the channel
2. When each check suite passes, "**Status updated:** ✅ {check name} passed" is posted to the thread (one per workflow); parent stays "Ready for review" until an approval is received
3. Reviews (approved, changes requested, commented, dismissed) are posted as thread replies; an approval promotes to "Ready to merge" when checks have passed
4. On each subsequent status change, the bot:
   - Creates a thread on the parent message (if not already created)
   - Posts a status update reply in the thread ("**Status updated:** <emoji> Status")
   - Patches the parent message header/status (preserving body, author, branches)
5. If the parent message was deleted, the bot creates a new one on the next update

For repos that don't require reviews, the parent stays "Ready for review" until merged; the thread shows per-check pass messages when each workflow completes.

## Generic Integration Setup

The generic webhook endpoint accepts structured JSON payloads from any system. It uses Bearer token authentication.

### Step 1: Generate a secret

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Set this as the `GENERIC__WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable for the bot.

### Step 2: Send webhooks

Include the secret as a Bearer token in the `X-Authorization` header.

#### Alert events

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-bot-host/webhooks/generic \
    -H "X-Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "event_type": "alert",
        "source": "vm-prod-01",
        "title": "Disk usage critical",
        "severity": "error",
        "details": "95% used on /data partition",
        "fields": {"Host": "vm-prod-01", "Partition": "/data"},
        "url": "https://monitoring.example.com/alert/123"
    }'
```

#### Deploy events

When a `deploy_id` is provided, the bot tracks deploys like PRs — the first event creates a parent message, and subsequent status changes for the same ID post thread updates and patch the parent.

```bash
# Start deploy (creates parent message)
curl -X POST https://your-bot-host/webhooks/generic \
    -H "X-Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "event_type": "deploy",
        "source": "api-service",
        "title": "",
        "environment": "production",
        "version": "2.5.0",
        "status": "started",
        "deploy_id": "deploy-42",
        "actor": "deployer",
        "body": "Added caching\nFixed login bug"
    }'

# Update status (posts thread update, patches parent)
curl -X POST https://your-bot-host/webhooks/generic \
    -H "X-Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "event_type": "deploy",
        "source": "api-service",
        "title": "",
        "environment": "production",
        "version": "2.5.0",
        "status": "succeeded",
        "deploy_id": "deploy-42"
    }'
```
